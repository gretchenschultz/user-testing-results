    <h2>Questions</h2>
      <h5>Do my users think the app is interesting or valuable?</h4>
        <p> User Answer: Yes, I thought the app was interesting, but it helps that I am an artist myself. I am always looking for new ways to be inspired and this helped me at least consider going out to a gallery. My Answer: I hope the app is valuable, I want to inspire people to inspire themselves. </p>
     <h5>Did my users use the app as I intended?</h4>
        <p> Yes, she used the app as I intended; She searched for a radius and chose a gallery to view.</p>
     <h5>Did my users encounter any bugs or broken features?</h4>
        <p>No, my user didnt encounter any bugs or broken features.</p>
     <h5>Did my users understand how to use the app?</h4>
        <p>Yes my user understood, but didn't realize at first that she had to hit the submit button to see the map results.</p>


    <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p> Use CSS coloring to help user determine that they need to click on the "show results" button for the map to generate the information. </p>
        <p> Add links for external webpage inspiration in case the user doesn't find what they want with the map. </p>
        <p> Add a background image to help inspire users.</p>
